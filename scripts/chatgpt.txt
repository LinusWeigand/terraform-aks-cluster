I have a few questions:

1. If I want to protect certain sections in my SPA, do I abstract them into external APIs?
2. What is included in the authorization request? Is the the code_challenge part of it?
3. When the SPA exchanges the authorization code, does it also need the client_id?
4. The id token and access token are stored as an http-only cookie in the browser right?
5. How does the spa generate the code_verifier?
6. When my SPA needs to access an API, how does the API know if the access token is valid and which users to accept? 

------------------------------------------------------------

I have a few questions:

1. In the authorization request, is the code_challenge set to "code" or is it the hashed code_verifier
2. What does storing the token in memory mean? Where is it exactly stored and how to do it in react?
3. The API needs to make a decision based on the users role you sayed. Where are the roles and users stored?

-----------------------------------------------------------

I have a few questions:

1. How does a user register?
